Enough Contrast?


Problem Statement:
For 2 Colors in RGB:
(R1, G1, B1) and (R2, G2, B2),

Brightness index is:
( 299*R1 + 587*G1 + 114*B1) / 1000

Brightness difference is:
Absolute difference in brighness indices

Hue difference is:
|R1 - R2| + |G1 - G2| + |B1 - B2|
where |x| is the absolute value of x

If Brightness difference is more than 125 and the Hue difference is more than 500 then the colors have sufficient contrast
Find out if the given color combos have sufficient contrast and get all the tests passing.

Tests:
initializes the color with the RGB values
returns the correct brightness index for (42, 21, 58)
returns the correct brightness index for (100, 200, 255)
returns the correct brighness difference between 2 colors
returns the correct hue difference between 2 colors
tells that there is is not enough contrast between (42, 21, 58) and (240, 41, 25)
tells that there is is enough contrast between (42, 42, 42) and (210, 210, 210)
