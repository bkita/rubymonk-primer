Find non-duplicate values in an Array

Problem Statement:
Given an Array, return the elements that are present exactly once in the array.

You need to write a method called non_duplicated_values to accomplish this task.

Example:
Given [1,2,2,3,3,4,5], the method should return [1,4,5]

Tests:
returns [1,4,5], given [1,2,2,3,3,4,5]
returns [1,3], given [1,2,2,3,4,4]
