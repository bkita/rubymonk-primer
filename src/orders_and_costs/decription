Orders and costs


Problem Statement:
A restaurant has incoming orders for which you need to compute the costs based on the menu.

You might get multiple orders at times.

Examples:
if the order is {:rice => 1, :noodles => 1}, and the menu is {:rice => 3, :noodles => 2}, then the cost is 5.
If the orders are {:rice => 1, :noodles => 1} and {:rice => 2, :noodles => 2} and the menu is {:rice => 3, :noodles => 2},
then the cost is 15.

Tests:
returns the correct cost for a single order
returns the correct costs for multiple orders
